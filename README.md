# Edits by ksprashu (changelog)
- Changed the M2.5 screws and M2.5 hex standoffs into M2 screw slots and M2 round standoffs. 
- Also added encoder profile cut-outs in the plate instead of just square cutouts. 
  - forked into two versions - choose the right one based on clearance of plates from PCB depending on spacer height used. 
  - v1 is square cut outs for encoder slots
  - v2 has additional clearance cutouts for encoder legs
- Finally added cutouts for OLED guard within the drawing itself.

In addition I've moved the drawing around a little offset from the sides to ensure clean cutting by laser. I've also added some offsets between some of the layers for better cutting tolerance.

Much props to original designers of this case. It's fantastic.

# Lily58 Pro Acrylic Case

This case was inspired by [FateNozomi](https://github.com/FateNozomi). The case was not designed originally for the use of Ponoko, and I reused some parts from my original kit for the oled cover. Before uploading my designs, I figured I should make it Ponoko ready.
 Disclaimer: Keyboard in photos were not cut from Ponoko. Use these files at your own risk. OLED standoffs in the pictures are from the Lily58 kit I purchased.
